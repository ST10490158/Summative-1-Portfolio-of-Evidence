# Summative-1-Portfolio-of-Evidence
A number of improvements were made to the American Red Cross website during its development in order to improve its general design, usability, and interactivity. A better user experience was produced by enhancing the simple tab navigation with fluid animations made with JavaScript and CSS that let each component fade in when selected. Mismatched tab ID issues have been fixed, so that all navigation links—including the "Contact" and "Budget and Referencing" tabs, which were previously inoperable—function properly.
The "Location" tab now has an image enlargement feature that lets users click on an image to view it in a larger, modal-style popup with a zoom-in animation and a close button. In order to improve content accessibility, a search box was added beneath the navigation bar. Users may now enter a keyword, and the website will instantly highlight and go to the word that matches.
Near the bottom of the page, a "Follow Us" box was added to improve professionalism and connectedness. This contains the handles and icons for the official Red Cross accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. They are all beautifully matched with Flexbox and have direct links to the sites. Last but not least, the social media area was raised higher on the page by adjusting the spacing so that it is comfortably above the footer rather than crammed at the bottom. When combined, these enhancements offer a cutting-edge, captivating, and intuitive browsing experience.
